# ECO-Guard: An Integrated AI-Sensor System for Monitoring Wildlife and Sustainable Forest Management

## Introduction

Welcome to "The ECO-Guard" initiative, where environmental responsibility and innovation unite to empower sustainable tourism and wildlife preservation. This project is the result of collaborative efforts by Ch. Nikhilesh Krishna, Sujay Bharath Raj, N. Kireeti Sai Bharadwaj, and Avishek Rauniyar, students of S2-B.Tech AIE A Batch. We are excited to share our experiences and outcomes from this journey of exploration and discovery.

## Project Overview

🌿"The ECO-Guard" aligns with multiple Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) like:

- Responsible Consumption and Production (SDG 12)
- Climate Action (SDG 13)
- Life on Land (SDG 15)
- Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure (SDG 9)
- Sustainable Cities and Communities (SDG 11)
- Partnerships for the Goals (SDG 17)

### Problem Definition

With rapid urbanization and deforestation, wildlife habitats and ecosystems are constantly threatened. Sustainable tourism often overlooks the environmental impact on local flora and fauna. A robust, real-time monitoring system is critical to managing wildlife conservation, forest management, and responsible tourism. "The ECO-Guard" addresses this gap by providing a scalable IoT solution that leverages AI to support these efforts.

### Abstract

Our project centres around an IoT-based system designed to advance sustainable tourism and wildlife conservation. Through the use of technology and ecological awareness, we foster a symbiotic relationship between people and nature, reducing ecological footprints and protecting biodiversity.🌳🔍

### Key Features

1. **Smart Sensor Integration**: Advanced sensors capture environmental metrics such as temperature, humidity, air quality, and wildlife activity in real-time. This enables data-driven decisions for effective forest management.🦋🌍

2. **AI-Powered Insights**: 📊 Machine learning models transform data into actionable insights, giving forest rangers and conservationists invaluable tools for ecological preservation.

3. **Tourist Guidance**: 🌐 A network of interconnected devices guides tourists through the ecosystem, ensuring minimal ecological disturbance and a sustainable, immersive experience.

4. **Positive Impact**: By integrating various SDGs, our project is a climate action initiative that promotes biodiversity, sustainable tourism, and community support.

## Project Showcase

We presented "The ECO-Guard" at the "UNLEASHING THE IMPACT OF SDG IN REAL WORLD APPLICATION OF ENERGY AND AI" expo and poster presentation hosted by the School of Computing and School of Engineering at Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham, Kollam, India, on August 17th, 2023.
